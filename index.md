Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method of analyzing and summarizing data sets to understand their main characteristics, often using data visualization techniques. EDA is used to see what the data can reveal beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis-testing task. It provides a better understanding of data set variables and their relationships.

## Fraud Detection

Fraud detection is a critical activity in business operations, particularly in sectors like banking and insurance. It involves identifying patterns, anomalies, and potential suspicious activities that might indicate fraudulent transactions. Data scientists use various techniques such as data mining, machine learning, and anomaly detection to detect fraud. These sophisticated algorithms and big data analysis help in early and accurate identification of suspicious activities, thereby preventing potential financial loss or identity theft.
